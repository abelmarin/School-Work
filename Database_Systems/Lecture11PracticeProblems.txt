PROBLEMS FOR WEDNESDAY 2/19:
-----------------------------

Read 3.1-3.5 and make sure you understand:

Functional dependencies
Deciding whether sets of functional dependencies are equivalent
Finding the closure of a set of attributes
Superkeys, candidate keys, and prime attributes
Boyce-Codd Normal Form

1.

For R(a,b,c):

E = { c->a , a->b , b->c }

F = { c->a , b->a , a->c }

Are E and F equivalent?
(That is, can every functional depenency in the set E 
be derived from the set F, and vice versa?) 

Add a->b to the set F -- does the answer change?


2.

For R(A,B,C,D):

F = { A->C , BC->D , C->A , D->B }

Find as many superkeys of R as you can.

Out of those superkeys, which ones are candidate keys?

Which attributes are prime attributes?

Is F in BCNF?
(That is, does every functional dependency have a
superkey as its determinant?)
