SOLUTIONS FOR WEDNESDAY 2/19:
-----------------------------

1.

For R(a,b,c):

E = { c->a , a->b , b->c }

F = { c->a , b->a , a->c }

Are E and F equivalent?
(That is, can every functional depenency in the set E 
be derived from the set F, and vice versa?) 

---

Can E derive every functional dependency in F?

c->a? {c}+ = {c, a, b}, so c->a can be derived.
b->a? {b}+ = {b, c, a}, so b->a can be derived.
a->c? {a}+ = {a, b, c}, so a->c can be derived.

Yes, E can derive everything in F.

Can F derive every functional dependency in E?

c->a? {c}+ = {c, a}, so c->a can be derived.
a->b? {a}+ = {a, c}, so a->b cannot be derived!
b->c? {b}+ = {b, a, c}, so b->c can be derived.

No, there is something in E (a->b) that F cannot derive.

Therefore E and F are not equivalent.

---

Add a->b to the set F -- does the answer change?

---

Yes, if a->b is added to F, then E and F are equivalent.

2.

For R(A,B,C,D):

F = { A->C , BC->D , C->A , D->B }

Find as many superkeys of R as you can.

---

Superkeys:

AB
AD
BC
CD
ABC
ABD
ACD
BCD
ABCD

For each of these sets, the closure is ABCD.

---

Out of those superkeys, which ones are candidate keys?

---

Candidate keys:

AB
AD
BC
CD

For each of these sets, the set is a superkey
but no proper subset of it is a superkey.

---

Which attributes are prime attributes?

---

A, B, C, D -- every attribute is part of some candidate key.

---

Is R in BCNF?
(That is, does every functional dependency have a
superkey as its determinant?)

---

No. A->C , C->A , and D->B all have determinants that are
_not_ superkeys, so R is not in BCNF.
