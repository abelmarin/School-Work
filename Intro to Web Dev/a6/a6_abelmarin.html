    <!-- 
        Question #1: It was necessary to use the parseFloat function since
        when a value is retieved from a form it is automatically a string. 
        Therefore in order to run mathamatical operations on it we need to convert
        it into a number.
        Question #2: I used the parseFloat function since the page does not specify
        what type of numbers are being used. Therefore I used parseFloat in order to
        account for ints as well as floats.
        Question #3: If you want your page to be visible you should not submit a ZIP
        file because what you want the user to view is the html files. Also, web servers
        don't know how to work with ZIP files.
