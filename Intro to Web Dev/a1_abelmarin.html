    <h1>Assignment #1</h1>
    <h2>Abel Marin</h2>

    <h2>Question #1</h2>
    <p>A couple of alternative attributes for the img tag besides the
        src and alt attributes is height and width. These specify
        the height and width of an image when it is displayed in the browser.</p>

    <h2>Question #2</h2>
    <p>An account on a web server is needed in order to store files and resources which will then 
        be displayed on the internet. A web server is software which runs on a computer which is 
        connected to the internet. The web server waits for requests for documents.</p>

    <h2>Question #3</h2>
    <p>Naming conventions for filenames in this course include having no spaces, no capitol letters, 
        including the .html file extension, and all words should be seperated by underscores.</p>
    <p>These naming conventions apply to all files and folders. Although, of course, file extensions 
        will be different for all files types.</p>

    <h2>Question #4</h2>
    <p>If an online student runs into difficulties scheduling an exam, then 
        they should contact the Online Learning Staff. This goes for any questions 
        that a person might have. The student should not contact the instructor. This 
        is because the instructor has nothing to do with the scheduling of exams.</p>

    <h2>Question #5</h2>
    <p>It is very important to subscribe to News postings because these contain very 
        important information about the course. This is also where all communications will be.
        I, Abel Marin, confirm that I have subscribed to news postings.</p>

    <h2>Question #6</h2>
    <p>The due date is the official day on which an assignment is due. 
        While the end date represents a grace period during which an assignment 
        can be turned in. After the due date an assignment will be docked 3 points for each day
        that the assignment is late. After the end date an assignment cannot be turned in on D2L.</p>

    <h2>Question #7</h2>
    <p>For most quizes, only the first attempt is recorded. Although, you can take the quiz 
        as many times as you would like. The only exception to this is the syllabus quiz 
        which can be taken as many times as you like.</p>

    <h2>Question #8</h2>
    <p>A score below a 50% on the final exam means that a student cannot recieve higher than
        a C- on the course grade. A score this low may also require the student to discuss code 
        with the instructor.</p>
